## Overview  <a name="overview"></a>
This is a reference application to demonstrate how MBEP APIs can be used.
To call these APIs, consumer key and .p12 file required from your project on Mastercard Developers.

## Requirements  <a name="requirements"></a>

- [Mastercard Developers Account](https://developer.mastercard.com/dashboard) with access to "MBEP" API
- [Java 11](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Apache maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- A text Editor or any IDE

## Frameworks/Libraries <a name="frameworks"></a>
- Apache Maven
- OpenAPI Generator

## Integrating with OpenAPI Generator <a name="OpenAPI_Generator"></a>

OpenAPI Generator generates API client libraries from OpenAPI Specs. It provides generators and library templates for supporting multiple languages and frameworks.
Check [Generating and Configuring a Mastercard API Client](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/security-and-authentication/generating-and-configuring-a-mastercard-api-client/) to know more about how to generate a simple API client for consuming APIs.

### Generating The API Client Sources
Now that you have all the dependencies you need, you can generate the sources. To do this, use one of the following two methods:

```Using IDE```

- **Method 1** <br>
In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Maven window (View > Tool Windows > Maven). Click the icons ```Reimport All Maven Projects``` and ```Generate Sources and Update Folders for All Projects```

- **Method 2** <br>
In the same menu, navigate to the commands ({Project name} > Lifecycle), select ```clean``` and ```compile``` then click the icon ```Run Maven Build```.

```Using Terminal```

Navigate to the root directory of the project within a terminal window and execute ```mvn clean compile``` command.

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
1. Create your account on [Mastercard Developers](https://developer.mastercard.com/) if you don't have it already.
2. Create a new project here and add ***MBEP*** to it and click continue.
3. Download Sandbox Signing Key, a ```.p12``` file will be downloaded.
4. In the Client Encryption Keys section of the dashboard, click on the ```Actions``` dropdown and download the client encryption key, a ``.pem``` file will be downloaded. 
5. Copy the downloaded ```.p12``` and ```.pem``` files to ```src/main/resources``` folder in your code.
6. Open ```src/main/resources/application.properties``` and configure:
    - ```mastercard.mbep.client.p12.path ```- Path to keystore (.p12) file, just change the name as per the downloaded file in step 5. 
    - ```mastercard.mbep.client.ref.app.consumer.key``` - Copy the Consumer key from "Sandbox/Production Keys" section on your project page
    - ```mastercard.mbep.client.ref.app.keystore.alias``` - Alias of your key. Default key alias for the sandbox is ```keyalias```.
    - ```mastercard.mbep.client.ref.app.keystore.password``` -  Password of your Keystore. Default keystore password for sandbox project is ```keystorepassword```.
    - ```mastercard.mbep.client.ref.app.encryption.file ```- Path to encryption key (.pem) file, just change the name as per the downloaded file in step 5, e.g. ```src/main/resources/<fileName>.pem```.

## Use-Cases <a name="use-cases"></a>
1. **Get Benefits**
Endpoint: "/benefits".
Used to get benefits of the user.
   
2. **Check Eligibility**    
Endpoint: "/eligibility".
Used to check eligibility of a credit card in mbep program for a specific benefit. Access to this API requires mapping of client ID, please contact your mastercard representative to get this access.

3. **Create Redemptions**    
Endpoint: "/redemptions".
Used to create a redemption for a credit card that was previously enrolled through the eligibilities resource. Access to this API requires mapping of client ID, please contact your mastercard representative to get this access.
   

More details can be found [here](https://developer.mastercard.com/mbep/documentation/use-cases/).


## Execute the Use-Cases   <a name="execute-the-use-cases"></a>
Below are the APIs exposed by this application: 
       - GET  <HOST>/mbep/benefits
       - POST <Host>/mbep/eligibility      
       - POST <Host>/mbep/redemptions            

Once you have added the correct properties, you are ready to build the application. You can do this by navigating to the projectâ€™s base directory from the terminal and then by running the following command.

`mvn clean install`

When the project builds successfully, you can run the following command to start the project  
- Run ```java -jar target/mbep-1.0.0.jar``` command to run the application.
- Open the browser and enter the url ```http://localhost:5001/mbep/``` and you will land on benefits page.
- Click on ```benefits```, ```eligibility``` or ```redemeptions``` tab and enter the details as required.
- When submitted you will get JSON response for each service. 
    
**NOTE:**   
    - Update request with valid details in json files under location ```/src/main/resources/templates/``` in order to execute these apis successfully.  
    - For each new call, you should change the email address,such as, dane+101@ifonly.com or dane+102@ifonly.com. If you use the same email address, you may get an error that the benefit has already been redeemed (this is expected). For each new call, you should change the card number. Use the number generator to generate a number that passes the MOD10/Luhn test. The range of eligible PANs is 5555555555550000 through 5555555555559999.
